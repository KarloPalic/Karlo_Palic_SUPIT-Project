                    believe that a person is ready to progress only when he finds balance in life. Therefore, we create
                    an environment that will equally encourage the quality of education and a fulfilling and quality
                    life. Investing in education always means investing in yourself. We believe that it is precisely by
                    enrolling in a study or education program that we achieve a balance between daily obligations and
                    the quality time we set aside for ourselves.</p>

                    and certificates for the quality of our teaching programs and processes, as well as top passionate
                    lecturers who transmit that spark to all students and attendees who come to Algebra. On the way to
                    finding what we love, there is that moment when we realize that we can do it and we want to do it,
                    we call that moment a spark, that's why we want everyone who is part of Algebra to become excellent

                        September 1998, it recorded the first significant increase in the number of service users, and
                        through multi-digit growth in the years 1999 and 2000, it established itself on the adult
